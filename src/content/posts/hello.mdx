Hello! My first blog post is here.

```js title="test-file.js"
console.log('This code is syntax highlighted!')
```

```powershell title="PowerShell terminal example"
Write-Output "This one has a title!"
```

```sh frame="none"
echo "Look ma, no frame!"
```

```ps frame="none" title="PowerShell Profile.ps1" {2} del={1} ins={3}
# Without overriding, this would be a terminal frame
function Watch-Tail { Get-Content -Tail 20 -Wait $args }
New-Alias tail Watch-Tail
```
